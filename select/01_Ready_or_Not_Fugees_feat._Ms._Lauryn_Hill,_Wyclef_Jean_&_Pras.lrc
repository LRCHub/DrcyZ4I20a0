[00:10.42] Ready or not, here I come
[00:13.37] You can't hide
[00:15.52] Gonna find you
[00:18.33] And take it slowly
[00:21.34] Ready or not, here I come
[00:24.03] You can't hide
[00:26.29] Gonna find you
[00:29.19] And make you want me
[00:39.19] 
[00:32.09] Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake
[00:34.86] Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
[00:37.16] Jail bars ain't golden gates those who fake, they break
[00:40.43] When they meet their 400 pound mate
[00:42.64] If I could rule the world, everyone would have a gun
[00:45.54] In the ghetto of course, when giddyupin' on their horse
[00:48.42] I kick a rhyme drinkin' moonshine
[00:50.67] I pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased
[01:13.67] 
[00:53.48] But no don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
[00:56.00] Thinkin' 'bout the robbery, that I did last week
[00:59.24] Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
[01:01.60] I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
[01:04.47] Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
[01:06.96] My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
[01:09.87] I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
[01:12.57] A born again hooligan only to be king again
[01:34.07] 
[01:15.23] Ready or not, here I come
[01:17.80] You can't hide
[01:20.23] Gonna find you
[01:22.80] And take it slowly
[01:25.82] Ready or not, here I come
[01:28.53] You can't hide
[01:31.04] Gonna find you
[01:33.64] And make you want me
[01:43.64] 
[01:36.51] Yo, I play my enemies like a game of chess
[01:39.36] Where I rest, no stress, if you don't smoke sess, lest
[01:42.28] I must confess, my destiny's manifest
[01:44.76] In some Goretex and sweats I make treks like I'm homeless
[02:13.26] 
[01:48.29] Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
[01:50.57] Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness, yes
[01:53.55] Bless you if you represent the Fu
[01:55.48] But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're Doo Doo
[02:23.98] 
[01:58.44] Voodoo, I can do what you do, easy
[02:00.92] Believe me, frontin' niggas give me heebie-jeebies
[02:04.12] So while you're imitating Al Capone
[02:06.18] I'll be Nina Simone and defacating on your microphone
[02:32.68] 
[02:09.27] Ready or not, here I come
[02:11.64] You can't hide
[02:14.06] Gonna find you
[02:16.85] And take it slowly
[02:25.85] 
[02:20.65] You can't run away
[02:23.10] From these styles I got, oh baby, hey, baby
[02:27.46] 'Cause I got a lot, oh, yeah
[02:31.11] And anywhere you go
[02:34.07] My whole crew's gonna know, oh baby, hey, baby
[02:38.13] You can't hide from the block, oh no
[02:56.13] 
[02:41.39] Ready or not, refugees takin' over
[02:44.11] The Buffalo soldier, dreadlock Rasta
[02:46.74] On the 12th hour, fly by in my bomber
[02:49.52] Crews run for cover, now they're under pushin' up flowers
[02:52.51] Superfly true lies, do or die (he's super fly)
[02:54.76] Toss me high, only puff la, with my crew from Lakay
[02:57.56] I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
[03:00.35] Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay (yes, sir)
[03:28.35] 
[03:03.11] Ready or not, here I come
[03:05.57] You can't hide (ay, yo nobody move)

[03:19.07] Gonna find you
[03:21.49] And make you want me

[03:24.50] Ready or not, here I come
[03:26.91] You can't hide (you know the)
[03:29.52] Gonna find you
[03:32.12] And take it slowly
[03:35.10] Ready or not, here I come
[03:37.99] You can't hide
[03:40.36] Gonna find you
[03:42.96] And make you want me
