I've been dreamin' of you
I've been thinking 'bout you
All those days are gone, years gone by
Look at the time now

Ready or not,
Here it is
Take my lovin'
Here it comes
Make room for love
Here it is, take my lovin'
It's for you
For you

I've been livin' a lie. Livin' a lie
I've been wonderin' why
Love's not what it seems
Even in your dreams
Look at the time fly
Look at the time fly

Here it is
Take my lovin'
Here it comes
Make room for love
Here it is
Take my lovin'
It's for you
It's for you
Keep givin' you lovin'
Keep, Keep givin' you lovin'
Keep givin' you lovin' all night long

Look at the time fly
I'm still thinkin' of you, you

Ready or not,
Here it is
Take my lovin'
Make room for love
Here it is
Take my lovin'
Here it comes
Make room for love
Here it is, here it is
It's for you
It's for you, oh baby
Whether your ready or not
Whether your ready or not
Whether your ready or not
Whether your ready or not
