Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me
Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake
Those who could relate know the
World is not cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates, those who fake
They break
When they meet their 400-pound mate
If I could rule the world
Everyone would have a gun
In the ghetto of course
Getting on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinking moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete
For the deceased but, no, don't weep
I've been in a state of sleep
Thinking 'bout the robbery that
I did last week
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pellet
Guns from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to
See if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me
I play my enemies like a game of chess
Where I rest, no stress
If you don't smoke sess
Lest I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Goretex and sweats
I make treks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty, like Elliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's
Brew if you're doo doo
Voodoo I can do what you do, easy
Believe me, fronting gives me heebie-jeebies
So while you're imitating Al Capone
I'll be Nina Simone and
Defecating on your microphone
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me
You can't run away from these styles I got
Oh baby, hey baby
‘Cause I got a lot, oh yeah
And anywhere you go my whole crew gonna know
Oh baby, hey baby
You can't hide from the block, oh no
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
I'm gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me
